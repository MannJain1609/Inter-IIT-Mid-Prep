0,Time evolution of cyclotron line of Her X-1: a detailed statistical analysis including new AstroSat data,"The cyclotron line feature in the X-ray spectrum of the accretion-powered pulsar Her X-1 has been observed and monitored for over three decades. The line energy exhibited a slow secular decline over the period 1995-2014, with a possible (not confirmed) indication of a reversal thereafter. Recent works have shown that the temporal evolution of the line energy may be modelled as a flattening after an earlier decrease until MJD 55400 (±200). In this work, we present the results of AstroSat observations in the context of earlier data and offer a common interpretation through a detailed study of temporal and flux dependence. We find that the variation of the line energy does not support an upward trend but is consistent with the reported flattening after an earlier decrease until MJD $54487^{+515}_{-469}$ .","Bala, S., Bhattacharya, D., Staubert, R., & Maitra, C.",2020MNRAS.497.1029B,"stars: neutron, stars: pulsars: individual: Her X-1, X-rays: binaries, Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"

0,Coronal vertical structure variations in normal branch of GX 17+2: AstroSat's SXT and LAXPC perspective,"We performed spectro-temporal analysis in the 0.8-50 keV energy band of the neutron star Z source GX 17+2 using AstroSat Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) and Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter (LAXPC) data. The source was found to vary in the normal branch (NB) of the hardness-intensity diagram. Cross-correlation studies of LAXPC light curves in soft and hard X-ray band unveiled anticorrelated lags of the order of few hundred seconds. For the first time, cross-correlation studies were performed using SXT soft and LAXPC hard light curves and they exhibited correlated and anticorrelated lags of the order of a hundred seconds. Power density spectrum displayed normal branch oscillations (NBOs) of 6.7-7.8 Hz (quality factor 1.5-4.0). Spectral modelling resulted in inner disc radius of ∼12-16 km with Γ ∼ 2.31-2.44 indicating that disc is close to the innermost stable circular orbit and a similar value of disc radius was noticed based on the reflection model. Different methods were used to constrain the corona size in GX 17+2. Using the detected lags, corona size was found to be 27-46 km (β = 0.1, β = v<SUB>corona</SUB>/v<SUB>disc</SUB>) and 138-231 km (β = 0.5). Assuming the X-ray emission to be arising from the boundary layer (BL), its size was determined to be 57-71 km. Assuming that BL is ionizing the disc's inner region, its size was constrained to ∼19-86 km. Using NBO frequency, the transition shell radius was found to be around 32 km. Observed lags and no movement of the inner disc front strongly indicate that the varying corona structure is causing the X-ray variation in the NB of Z source GX 17+2.","Malu, S., Sriram, K., & Agrawal, V.

0,Thermonuclear X-ray bursts detected in Cyg X-2 using AstroSat/LAXPC,"We report the detection of 5 Type-1 thermonuclear X-ray bursts and one burst-like event in the neutron star LMXB source, Cyg X-2 using X-ray data obtained with the Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter (LAXPC) instrument on board AstroSat. We carry out an energy resolved burst profile analysis as well as time resolved spectral analysis for each of the bursts and characterize their properties. All bursts are weak with burst peak-to-persistent intensity ratios < 3, decay times ~ 1.2 s, and with fluences ~ 1 ×10<SUP>-8</SUP> ergs/cm<SUP>2</SUP>, indicating that the observed bursts are Helium fuelled flashes. An evolution of the blackbody temperature and radius is also observed during each burst. We carry out a search for Burst Oscillations (BO) and derive upper limits to the rms fractional amplitude for BO (for all the bursts) to be ~ 1%. We also carried out search for Quasi Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) in the power density spectra and we obtain upper limits to the fractional rms amplitude as ~ 3.4% at frequencies close to ~ 5.6 Hz. We further carry out spectral and timing analysis of the non-burst persistent emission along with a study of the hardness-intensity and colour-colour diagrams. Using results from our analysis we infer that during this observation in 2016, Cyg X-2 can be characterized as being in the early Flaring Branch (FB) with a puffed up accretion disk and a clumpy coronal structure while undergoing medium-to-high levels of accretion.","Devasia, J., Raman, G., & Paul, B.",2021NewA...8301479D,"X-Rays: Binaries, (Stars:) stars: Neutron, Accretion, Accretion discs, Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"

0,Broad-band 'spectro-temporal' features of extragalactic black hole binaries LMC X-1 and LMC X-3: an AstroSat perspective,"We present the first results of extragalactic black hole (BH) X-ray binaries LMC X-1 and LMC X-3 using all the archival and legacy observations by AstroSat during the period of 2016-2020. Broad-band energy spectra (0.5-20 keV) of both sources obtained from the Soft X-ray Telescope and Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter on-board AstroSat are characterized by strong thermal disc blackbody component (kT<SUB>in</SUB> ∼ 1keV, $f_{\mathrm{ disc}}\ 79{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ ) along with a steep power-law (Γ ∼ 2.4-3.2). Bolometric luminosity of LMC X-1 varies from $7{\,\mathrm{ to}\,}10{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of Eddinon luminosity (L<SUB>Edd</SUB>) and for LMC X-3 is in the range $7{-}13{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of L<SUB>Edd</SUB>. We study the long-term variation of light curve using MAXI data and find the fractional variance to be ${\sim}25{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ for LMC X-1 and ${\sim}53{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ for LMC X-3. We examine the temporal properties of both sources and obtain fractional rms variability of power density spectrum in the frequency range 0.002-10 Hz to be ${\sim}9{}-17{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ for LMC X-1, and ${\sim}7{}-11{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ for LMC X-3. The 'spectro-temporal' properties indicate both sources are in thermally dominated soft state. By modelling the spectra with relativistic accretion disc model, we determine the mass of LMC X-1 and LMC X-3 in the range $7.64{-}10.00$ and $5.35{-}6.22\, \mathrm{ M}_{\odot }$ , respectively. We also constrain the spin of LMC X-1 to be in the range 0.82-0.92 and that of LMC X-3 in 0.22-0.41 with 90 per cent confidence. We discuss the implications of our results in the context of accretion dynamics around the BH binaries and compare it with the previous findings of both sources.","Bhuvana, G.

0,The Period Change of Cyg X-3,"By using available archival X-ray data, we significantly extended the list of times of X-ray minima. The new list includes 65 data points obtained by critically reanalyzing RXTE ASM data, 88 data points based on observations by MAXI, and 2 data points based on observations by SUZAKU and AstroSat. Analyzing the data along with times of X-ray minima available from the literature, we provide the most accurate estimate of the rate of period change to date. We do not confirm the existence of a second derivative of the orbital period suggested by some authors earlier. Instead, we find that the changes in the period can be fit by a sum of quadratic and sinusoidal functions. The period of sinusoidal variations is 15.79 yr. They can be related either to apsidal motion in the close binary with eccentricity e ≃ 0.03 or to the presence of a third body with a mass of about 0.7 M <SUB>☉</SUB> located at a distance ∼16 au from the close binary.","Antokhin, I.
