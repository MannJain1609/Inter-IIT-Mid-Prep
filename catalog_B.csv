It is proposed that, as the PRGs evolve through time the polar ring structure- the active region of star formation- disappears and which results in the formation of an elliptical galaxy. The lack of deep photometric observation currently constrains our understanding of the evolution of galaxies. We carried out an initial study for 306 PRGs (identified to date) using the SDSS data and made a subsample of PRGs with extended polar structure.
